This package contains the slides I presented on the Perl Whirl I Cruise.
It should eventuelly become a tutorial on how to use CPAN.pm.

The slides were prepared for usage with magicpoint.
Magicpoint can be found at http://www.Mew.org/mgp/ The PostScript file
was generated with mgp2ps which comes with the Magicpoint distribution.
