This package is only contained in this distribution to have it indexed
by the indexer, so it can be found via CPAN::Site or CPAN.pm. The
distribution does not contain code. It contains the slides of my CPAN
talk on the Alaska Geek Cruise 2000.

Thanks to Neil Bauman and Geek Cruises Inc. for the invitation on the
cruise and to the fellow perl geeks that helped to make the Cruise the
success it was.
